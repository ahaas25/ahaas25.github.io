                    <p>I'm a Computer Science student studying at the University of Maryland, College Park
                    <p>
                    <p>I've always had a passion for coding, and now I'm looking to make it my career!<br>
                        I have experience in MIPS Assembly, C, C#, C++, Java, Python, SQL, XAML, HTML, CSS, and their
                        respective IDEs.<br></p>

                <p>I wrote this program in C with the goals of clean code, good memory management, and learning C. <br>
                    Typing-Test-C is a terminal based program which uses the <em>ncurses</em> library. <br>
                    The program works by providing the user with a prompt of words, which they type as fast as they can.
                    <br>
                    Once completed, it prints the user's performance to the screen and saves the results locally, which
                    can be viewed in the Stats page.</p>

                <p>A program designed to improve user typing speed an accuracy. Written in Java using the AWT library
                    for graphics.</p>
                <p>Object was demonstrating Java skills, learning AWT, and creating an intuitive user-interface. This
                    was written over my 2021 winter break.<br>
                    The program keeps track of each key and shows the user which keys take them the longest to press and
                    which they mis-type the most.</p>
